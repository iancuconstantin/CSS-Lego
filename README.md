# CSS-Lego

## What I`v learned:

- the bootstrap grid layout

## Tasks

1. Create 3 cards which will be rendered on 3 columns when the browser width is larger then `768px` and 1 column when screen width is less then `768px`. Do not use any media queries, just css
    - When the browser width is larger then `768px` the cards look similar to the image below ![Cards](media/frontend/css-lego-cards.JPG)
    - When the browser width is less then `768px` each card is on a separate row

2. Visually enhance the form section of the page
    - The form section looks similar to this image ![Form](media/frontend/css-lego-form.JPG)

3. Visually enhance the table section
    - The table section look similar to this image ![Form](media/frontend/css-lego-table.JPG)
    - Each time the user navigates to the `Promotions` page 3 random products are chosen from the 3 available categories
